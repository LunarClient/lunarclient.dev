# Deep Links

The Lunar Client v3 launcher adds support for deep links, the ability to generate custom URLs starting with `lunarclient://`,
which will interact directly with the launcher and the user's game. Deep links can be placed on websites, in Discord, or
anywhere else users have the ability to click on links.

If you have further questions about deep link support, you can join the [Lunar Client Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/3T9Atyb6pf).
