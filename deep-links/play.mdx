# `lunarclient://play`

## Overview
This deep link allows you to connect a user directly to a Minecraft server from their web browser. This can be used to create
a smoother join process compared to the typical flow, where a user has to "Click to copy IP", potentially switch to the correct Minecraft
version, launch Minecraft, and then paste in the server IP.

## Query Parameters
* `serverId` - The [ServerMappings](https://lunarclient.dev/server-mappings/introduction) ID of your server.
* `serverAddress` - The hostname of your server.
* `serverPort` - The port of your server. Defaults to `25565` if not present.
* `forceRecommendedVersion` - If the launcher should automatically switch to your recommended version, rather than accepting any
  supported version. This is suggested if your server is highly optimized for one version of Minecraft. Defaults to `false` if not present.

Either `serverId` *or* `serverAddress` must be provided. If `serverId` is provided, the launcher will automatically use the IP defined in
[ServerMappings](https://lunarclient.dev/server-mappings/introduction). If `serverAddress` is provided, the launcher use `serverAddress`
and `serverPort` to build an IP to connect to. All normal features, such as SRV records, are supported.

`forceRecommendedVersion` will only function if the launcher can determine the recommended version for your server. If a `serverId` was
passed in, the launcher will use the recommended version from its [ServerMappings](https://lunarclient.dev/server-mappings/introduction)
entry. If a `serverAddress` was provided, and the launcher can associate the `serverAddress` with a
[ServerMappings](https://lunarclient.dev/server-mappings/introduction) entry, it will use the associated recommended version.
